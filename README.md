### Fire Risk Prediction Project
## Overview
This project aims to predict building fire risks using machine learning techniques. The approach integrates data preprocessing, multiple machine learning models, and ensemble techniques for robust fire risk prediction.

## Methodology
Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values and outliers.
One-hot encoding for categorical variables.
Standardizing numerical features.
Machine Learning Models:
Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM), and more.
Stacking ensemble for combining model predictions.
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
